<p>My name is Isabella Reeves, but I tend to go by Bella and use she/her pronouns. I’m 20 years old and pursuing a degree in Digital Media. Besides academics, my main hobbies that I spend my time on are baking, cooking, and playing video games with my siblings and friends. Although I also enjoy taking leisurely walks at the McHenry Dam, going on night drives around town, enjoying occasional shopping trips to once of the nearby malls, and recently I have found myself practicing my drawing skills.</p><br>
