<h2>Baking</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to my baking world, where flour meets sugar, and creativity comes to life! Baking is not just a hobby for me; it's a sweet escape into a world of delicious delights. Whether it's whipping up a batch of cookies or crafting intricate cakes, I find joy in every step of the baking process.

    One of my favorite treats to make is creme brulee. This classic dessert combines rich custard with a crunchy caramelized sugar topping. With this simple <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9039-vanilla-creme-brulee" target="_blank">recipe</a>, you can recreate this decadent delight in your own kitchen. Just a few ingredients and a little patience, and you'll have a dessert that's sure to impress your friends and family.

<h2>Cakes</h2>

<p>
    But let's not forget about cakes! Cakes are like edible canvases, waiting to be decorated and devoured. From fluffy vanilla cakes to indulgent chocolate creations, there's a cake for every occasion. Whether it's a birthday, anniversary, or just a Tuesday night, baking a cake always brings smiles. The cake shown here is a white chocolate raspberry cake made for my motherâ€™s birthday.
